# Linear Algebra Corpora

I intend to create a corpus for linear algebra based on open-source books. The first book (lightly processed by Deyan Ginev) can be found at
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1PTbDmPmuIYSHp3F5QEhZ6jeX84W69iwl  result from the Workshop 
"Open-source cyberinfrastructure supporting mathematics research" (https://aimath.org/pastworkshops/cyberinfrastructure.html)
