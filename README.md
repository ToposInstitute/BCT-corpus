# CT corpora
A directory to collect  corpora obtained from textbooks in Category Theory. We have permission from Tom Leinster, Emily Riehl, and Rob Goldblatt to use their books for experiments extracting math concepts.


The first corpus uses Leinster's book "Basic Category Theory".
Tom Leinster's book is CC 4.0 BY in the arxiv. 
Adding both pdf and tex source from https://arxiv.org/format/1612.09375.

Riehl's book "Category Theory in Context", was published in November 2016 by Dover Publications. 
Emily hosts a free PDF copy of her book [here](https://emilyriehl.github.io/files/context.pdf), see her [page](https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/context/).

Goldblatt's book "Topoi: The Categorial Analysis of Logic" is available as an Internet edition in the Cornell University Library Historical Mathematics Monographs Collection, 2002;
Dover Publications reprint, 2006;
Downloadable as [pdf](https://projecteuclid.org/ebooks/books-by-independent-authors/Topoi-The-Categorial-Analysis-of-Logic/toc/bia/1403013939) from Project Euclid, 2014. 


Harold Simmon's book, "An Introduction to Category Theory", version from 2010.
license not known, available from https://dl.icdst.org/pdfs/files3/589bdb0ed138159a2b3e5ccb4268a9f9.pdf

See the corpus of TAC (Theory and Applications of Categories) at https://github.com/ToposInstitute/tac-corpus and
the nLab corpus (circa 2020) at https://github.com/ToposInstitute/nlab-corpus.

The TAC corpus, the BCT corpus, and the nLab corpus can be searched and browsed at Parmesan http://www.jacobcollard.com/parmesan2/

# Linear Algebra Corpora

I intend to create a corpus for linear algebra based on open-source books. The first book (lightly processed by Deyan Ginev) can be found at
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1PTbDmPmuIYSHp3F5QEhZ6jeX84W69iwl a result from the Workshop 
"Open-source cyberinfrastructure supporting mathematics research" (https://aimath.org/pastworkshops/cyberinfrastructure.html)
